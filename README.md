PE file import analysis for Windows executables

Visual threat representation

Detailed scan reporting

Modern dark-themed interface

Requirements
Python 3.7+

Windows OS (for full PE analysis capabilities)

4GB RAM minimum

üî¥ CRITICAL: Known malware signatures

‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Suspicious patterns or risky commands

‚úÖ CLEAN: No threats detected

Threat Detection Capabilities
Signature Analysis
SHA-256 hash matching against known threats

Suspicious string detection (malware-related terms)

Command Detection
Identifies dangerous commands like:

eval, exec, system

base64_decode, base64_encode

powershell, cmd.exe, regsvr32

Evasion Technique Detection
Identifies common obfuscation patterns

Detects code hiding techniques

Executable Analysis
Analyzes Windows PE files (EXE, DLL, SYS)

Detects suspicious API imports

Identifies potential code injection techniques

Troubleshooting
Common Issues
Application not starting: Ensure all dependencies are installed

PE analysis errors: Verify file is a valid Windows executable

Scan freezes: Check file size (large files may take longer)

Performance Tips
Scan files smaller than 100MB for best performance

Close other resource-intensive applications during scanning

Run as Administrator for system file analysis
